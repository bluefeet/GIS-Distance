=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance - Calculate geographic distances.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GIS::Distance;
    
    # Use the GIS::Distance::Haversine formula by default:
    my $gis = GIS::Distance->new();
    
    # Or choose a different formula:
    my $gis = GIS::Distance->new( 'Polar' );
    
    my $distance = $gis->distance( $lat1,$lon1 => $lat2,$lon2 );
    
    print $distance->meters();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module calculates distances between geographic points on, at the moment,
planet Earth.  Various L</FORMULAS> are available that provide different levels
of accuracy versus speed.

L<GIS::Distance::Fast>, a separate distribution, ships with C implmentations of
some of the formulas shipped with GIS::Distance.  If you're looking for speed
then install it and the ::Fast formulas will be automatically used by this module.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 distance

    my $distance = $gis->distance( $lat1,$lon1 => $lat2,$lon2 );

Returns a L<Class::Measure::Length> object for the distance between the
two degree lats/lons.

See L</distance_km> to return raw kilometers instead.

=head2 distance_km

This works just like L</distance> but returns a raw kilometer measurement.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 formula

Returns the formula name which was passed as the first argument to C<new()>.

The formula can be specified as a partial or full module name for that
formula.  For example, if the formula is set to C<Haversine> as in:

    my $gis = GIS::Distance->new( 'Haversine' );

Then the following modules will be looked for in order:

    GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine
    GIS::Distance::Haversine
    Haversine

Note that a C<Fast::> version of the class will be looked for first.  By default
the C<Fast::> versions of the formulas, written in C, are not available and the
pure perl ones will be used instead.  If you would like the C<Fast::> formulas
then install L<GIS::Distance::Fast> and they will be automatically used.

You may disable the automatic use of the C<Fast::> formulas by setting the
C<GIS_DISTANCE_PP> environment variable.

=head2 args

Returns the formula arguments, an array ref, containing the rest of the
arguments passed to C<new()> (anything passed after the L</formula>).
Most formulas do not take arguments.  If they do it will be described in
their respective documentation.

=head2 module

Returns the fully qualified module name that L</formula> resolved to.

=head1 COORDINATES

When passing latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to L</distance> and
L</distance_km> they must always be in decimal degree format.  Here is some
sample code for converting from other formats to decimal:

    # DMS to Decimal
    my $decimal = $degrees + ($minutes/60) + ($seconds/3600);
    
    # Precision Six Integer to Decimal
    my $decimal = $integer * .000001;

If you want to convert from decimal radians to degrees you can use L<Math::Trig>'s
rad2deg function.

=head1 FORMULAS

These formulas come with this distribution:

L<GIS::Distance::Cosine>

L<GIS::Distance::GreatCircle>

L<GIS::Distance::Haversine>

L<GIS::Distance::MathTrig>

L<GIS::Distance::Polar>

L<GIS::Distance::Vincenty>

These formulas are available on CPAN:

L<GIS::Distance::Fast::Cosine>

L<GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine>

L<GIS::Distance::Fast::Vincenty>

L<GIS::Distance::GeoEllipsoid>

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<GIS::Distance::Lite> was long ago forked from GIS::Distance and modified
to have less dependencies.  Since then GIS::Distance itself has become
tremendously lighter dep-wise, and is still maintained, I suggest you not
use GIS::Distance::Lite.

L<Geo::Distance> and L<Geo::Distance::XS> have long been deprecated in favor
of using this module.

L<Geo::Inverse> seems to do some distance calculation using L<Geo::Ellipsoid>
but if you look at the source code it clearly states that the entire meat of
it is copied from Geo::Ellipsoid... so I'm not sure why it exists... just use
Geo::Ellipsoid or L<GIS::Distance::GeoEllipsoid> which wraps Geo::Ellipsoid
into the GIS::Distance interface.

L<Geo::Distance::Google> looks pretty neat.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Create a GIS::Coord class that represents a geographic coordinate.  Then modify
this module to accept input as either lat/lon pairs, or as GIS::Coord objects.
This would make coordinate conversion as described in L</COORDINATES> automatic.
Maybe use L<Geo::Point>.

=item *

Create some sort of equivalent to L<Geo::Distance>'s closest() method.

=item *

Write a formula module called GIS::Distance::Geoid.  Some very useful info is
at L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid>.

=item *

Make L<GIS::Distance::Google> (or some such name) and wrap it around
L<Geo::Distance::Google> (most likely).
