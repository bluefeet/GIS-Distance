=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance - Calculate geographic distances.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GIS::Distance;
    
    # Use the GIS::Distance::Haversine formula by default:
    my $gis = GIS::Distance->new();
    
    # Or choose a different formula:
    my $gis = GIS::Distance->new( 'Polar' );
    
    my $distance = $gis->distance( $lat1,$lon1 => $lat2,$lon2 );
    
    print $distance->meters();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module calculates distances between geographic points on, at the moment,
planet Earth.  Various L</FORMULAS> are available that provide different levels
of accuracy versus speed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 distance

    my $distance = $gis->distance( $lat1,$lon1 => $lat2,$lon2 );

Returns a L<Class::Measure::Length> object for the distance between the
two degree lats/lons.

See L</distance_km> to return raw kilometers instead.

=head2 distance_km

This works just like L</distance> but returns a raw kilometer measurement.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 formula

Returns the formula name which was passed as the first argument to C<new()>.

The formula can be specified as a partial or full module name for that
formula.  For example, if the formula is set to C<Haversine> as in:

    my $gis = GIS::Distance->new( 'Haversine' );

Then the following modules will be looked for in order:

    GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine
    GIS::Distance::Haversine
    Haversine

Note that a C<Fast::> version of the class will be looked for first.  By default
the C<Fast::> versions of the formulas, written in C, are not available and the
pure perl ones will be used instead.  If you would like the C<Fast::> formulas
then install L<GIS::Distance::Fast> and they will be automatically used.

=head2 args

Returns the formula arguments, an array ref, containing the rest of the
arguments passed to C<new()>.  Most formulas do not take arguments.  If
they do it will be described in their respective documentation.

=head2 module

Returns the fully qualified module name that L</formula> resolved to.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<GIS::Distance::Fast> - C implmentation of some of the formulas
shipped with GIS::Distance.  This greatly increases the speed at
which distance calculations can be made.

=head1 FORMULAS

L<GIS::Distance::Cosine>

L<GIS::Distance::GeoEllipsoid>

L<GIS::Distance::GreatCircle>

L<GIS::Distance::Haversine>

L<GIS::Distance::MathTrig>

L<GIS::Distance::Polar>

L<GIS::Distance::Vincenty>

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Create a GIS::Coord class that represents a geographic coordinate.  Then modify
this module to accept input as either lat/lon pairs, or as GIS::Coord objects.

=item *

Create some sort of equivalent to L<Geo::Distance>'s closest() method.

=item *

Write a formula module called GIS::Distance::Geoid.  Some very useful info is
at L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid>.
