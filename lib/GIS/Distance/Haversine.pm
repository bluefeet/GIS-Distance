# It seems to produce the same results at the hsin formula, so...
#
# my $dlon = $lon2 - $lon1;
# my $dlat = $lat2 - $lat1;
# my $a = (sin($dlat / 2)) ** 2

# $c = 2 * atan2(sqrt($a), sqrt(1 - $a));
#
# Maybe test for speed before tossing?

=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::Haversine - Exact spherical distance calculations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the default distance calculation for L<GIS::Distance> as
it keeps a good balance between speed and accuracy.

A faster (XS) version of this formula is available as
L<GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine>.

Normally this module is not used directly.  Instead L<GIS::Distance>
is used which in turn interfaces with the various formula modules.

=head1 FORMULA

    dlon = lon2 - lon1
    dlat = lat2 - lat1
    a = (sin(dlat/2))^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * (sin(dlon/2))^2
    c = 2 * atan2( sqrt(a), sqrt(1-a) )
    d = R * c
