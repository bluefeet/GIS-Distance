=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::ALT - Andoyer-Lambert-Thomas distance calculations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ALT formula is intended as a much faster, but slightly less accurate,
alternative of the L<GIS::Distance::Vincenty> formula. This formulas is
about 5x faster than Vincenty.

The code for this formula was taken from L<GIS::Distance::XS> and
modified to fit.

A faster (XS) version of this formula is available as
L<GIS::Distance::Fast::ALT>.

Normally this module is not used directly.  Instead L<GIS::Distance>
is used which in turn interfaces with the various formula classes.
