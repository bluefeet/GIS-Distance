=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::Polar - Polar coordinate flat-earth distance calculations. (BROKEN)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Supposedly this is a formula to better calculate distances at the
poles.

Normally this module is not used directly.  Instead L<GIS::Distance>
is used which in turn interfaces with the various formula modules.

=head1 BROKEN

While implimented, this formula has not been tested much.  If you use it
PLEASE share your results with the author.  I've tested the results of this
formula versus Vincenty and it appears that this formula is broken (or
the implementation is) as you can see in C<t/polar.t>.

=head1 FORMULA

    a = pi/2 - lat1
    b = pi/2 - lat2
    c = sqrt( a^2 + b^2 - 2 * a * b * cos(lon2 - lon1) )
    d = R * c
