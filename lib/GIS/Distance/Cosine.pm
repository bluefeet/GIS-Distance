=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::Cosine - Spherical law of cosines distance calculations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Although this formula is mathematically exact, it is unreliable for
small distances.  See L<GIS::Distance::MathTrig> for related details.

A faster (XS) version of this formula is available as
L<GIS::Distance::Fast::Cosine>.

Normally this module is not used directly.  Instead L<GIS::Distance>
is used which in turn interfaces with the various formula classes.

=head1 FORMULA

    a = sin(lat1) * sin(lat2)
    b = cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(lon2 - lon1)
    c = arccos(a + b)
    d = R * c
