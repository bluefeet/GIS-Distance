=head1 NAME

GIS::Distance::Cosine - Cosine distance calculations.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Although this formula is mathematically exact, it is unreliable for
small distances because the inverse cosine is ill-conditioned.

Normally this module is not used directly.  Instead L<GIS::Distance>
is used which in turn interfaces with the various formula modules.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

Takes none.

=head1 FORMULA

    a = sin(lat1) * sin(lat2)
    b = cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(lon2 - lon1)
    c = arccos(a + b)
    d = R * c
