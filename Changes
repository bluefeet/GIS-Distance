Revision history for Perl extension GIS::Distance.

0.12
 - Renamed from Geo::Distance to GIS::Distance.

0.11 : 2005-09-01
 - Fixed some errors in the documentation.
 - Added an highly accurate ellipsoid formula.
 - lon_field and lat_field were not being used by closest. (D. Hageman)

0.10 : 2005-07-11
 - The closest() method has a changed argument syntax and no longer 
   supports array searches.
 - The closest() method works!
 - A real gcd formula (still, hsin is much better).
 - Tweaked docs.
 - Added some tests (yay!).

0.09 : 2005-04-01
 - Modified the todo list to include ideas for future algorithms.
 - Fixed the nautical mile, mile, yard, and light second units.
 - Added the British spellings for kilometre, metre, and centimetre.
 - Added the poppy seed, barleycorn, rod, pole, perch, chain, 
   furlong, league, fathom, millimeter, and millimetre units.
 - The totw.pl script was written by Ren and can be used to 
   take over the world.

0.08 : 2005-03-20
 - Updated the README description.
 - Removed debug print()s.  Eeek!

0.07 : 2005-03-16
 - Intermixed documentation with code so it is easier to keep 
   the docs up-to-date.
 - OO interface only - method interface completely removed.
 - By default no units are defined.  Call default_units.
 - Slightly more precise measurement of the base kilometer rho.
 - Added "nautical mile" unit type.
 - Reworked the closest() function.

0.06 : 2004-06-29
 - Optional Haversine formula.
 - Misc documentation tweaks.

0.05 : 2003-03-19
 - Added a note in the documentation about the 
   inaccuracies of using Math::Trig.
 - The 'mile' unit was being calculated wrong which 
   meant it was returning very inaccurate distances.
 - Fixed a silly bug where a sub was being relied 
   on that no longer exists.
 - Documentation tweaks as usual.

0.04 : 2003-02-18
 - Documentation revised once again.
 - Added reg_unit() for adding your own unit type.
 - find_closest has been overhauled:
   - Now accepts more than one field in the 
     field=>'' parameter.
   - Will now return an array reference 
     of distances instead of attaching the 
     distances to the locations array ref.
   - A little more effecient.
   - Now accepts a count argument.
   - Accepts an array reference for searching. 
     Mostly good for testing, but who knows?
 - Removed geo_ portion of names for exported 
   functions.
 - Removed some of the input checking.  Just not 
   necessary.
 - Enhanced tests.  Now we're actually doing some 
   real testing.  Need more tests tho.

0.03 : 2003-02-15
 - Documentation modified.
 - Added find_closest() which accepts a $dbh for 
   searching in an SQL database.
 - distance_dirty() can now accept locations as 
   array refs.

0.02 : 2003-02-14
 - Based on a suggestion by Jack D. I migrated the code 
   to use Math::Trig for most of the distance math.
 - POD documentation written.
 - Object oriented interface created.
